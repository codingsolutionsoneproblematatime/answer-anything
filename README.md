🧠 Why I Built This
Answer Anything is designed to bring the power of GPT-4o’s vision model directly to your screen — turning your desktop into an interactive, explorable space. It’s like adding an “Explain This” button to your operating system. My goal was to create a tool that enhances curiosity, speeds up understanding, and eliminates context-switching.
